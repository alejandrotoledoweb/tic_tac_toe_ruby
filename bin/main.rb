# For this game we need:
# - collect the players info
# - show the board in the terminal all the time
# - lets decide who is going to play first
# - we start a loop counting the number of moves for the two players,
# - the loop works until we got a maximun of 9 moves and if anyone wins it's a draw
# - ask for a spot in the board for the first player
# - check if that move is a valid move
# - check if that move was a winning or draw move,update the board with the player_1's symbol
# - change players turn
# - ask for a spot in the board for the second player
# - check if that move is a valid move
# - check if that move was a winning or draw move,update the board with the player_2's symbol
# - display if there is a winner or is a draw
# - end of the game
