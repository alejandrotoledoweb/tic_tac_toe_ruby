# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this repository we create a Tic Tac Toe game. This game is designed to be played on your local machine in the terminal.

Built with Ruby.

## Game Rules

- each player has to input his/her name
- then each player has a turn to choose a spot in the board(input a number)
- then it continues until we got a winner or a draw
 You can win if you complete a row, column or diagonal with your symbol as I show you in the picture down below
