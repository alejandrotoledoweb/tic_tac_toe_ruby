# tic_tac_toe_ruby
> Building Tic Tac Toe game in Ruby
 In this repository, we will show you the source code of this game on Ruby programming language, how to run it and explain some related concepts.

 ## bin

 Within the `bin/` directory we generally put code that relates to running our actual program, running CLI applications Executable files are any files that contain instructions in a form that a computer's operating system or application can understand and follow. 

 ## lib

The lib/ or Library directory in most Ruby programs and the app/ directory in Rails projects or complex Ruby programs, is where the majority of our code lives. Within this directory are all the files that define what our program can do. All of the methods and classes our program needs are defined within the files in this directory. 
We spend the majority of our time building code in this directory...
